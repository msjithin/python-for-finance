Just a couple of fun stuff I am trying out with python.

Python exercises analysing stocks.
Required modules in requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
A simple stock time series web app:
To run web app
```
streamlit run stock-web-app.py
```

I am working on a more detailed analysis using 
stock-analysis-web-app.py and stock_analysis.py
```
streamlit run stock-analysis-web-app.py
```

Targets and achievements
- [x] Run web app locally
- [ ] Add Docker 
- [ ] Upload to cloud and ease access


:+1: The web app looks good.
